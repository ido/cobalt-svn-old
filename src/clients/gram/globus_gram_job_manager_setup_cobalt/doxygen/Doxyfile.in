# Doxyfile 1.2.6

# This file describes the settings to be used by doxygen for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#
# Include the standard part of the doxygen configuration:
#

@INCLUDE_PATH = @prefix@/share/doxygen

@INCLUDE = Doxyfile.include

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project. 

PROJECT_NAME           = "@lac_doxygen_project@"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = @VERSION@

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces. 

INPUT                  = @lac_doxygen_srcdirs@ \
                         @lac_doxygen_examples@

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank all files are included. 

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.c \
                         *.h \
                         @lac_doxygen_file_patterns@

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or 
# directories that contain example code fragments that are included (see 
# the \include command). 

EXAMPLE_PATH           = @lac_doxygen_examples@

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML header for 
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a 
# standard header.

HTML_HEADER            = @prefix@/share/doxygen/globus_head.html

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML footer for 
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a 
# standard footer.

HTML_FOOTER            = @prefix@/share/doxygen/globus_foot.html

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user defined cascading 
# style sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to 
# fine-tune the look of the HTML output. If the tag is left blank doxygen 
# will generate a default style sheet 

HTML_STYLESHEET        = @prefix@/share/doxygen/globus.css

# The LATEX_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal LaTeX header for 
# the generated latex document. The header should contain everything until 
# the first chapter. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a 
# standard header. Notice: only use this tag if you know what you are doing! 

LATEX_HEADER           = @prefix@/share/doxygen/globus_head.tex

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that 
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of 
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name 
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are 
# omitted =1 is assumed. 

PREDEFINED             = GLOBUS_DONT_DOCUMENT_INTERNAL \

                         @lac_doxygen_predefines@

# The TAGFILES tag can be used to specify one or more tagfiles. 

TAGFILES               = @lac_doxygen_tagfiles@

# When a file name is specified after GENERATE_TAGFILE, doxygen will create 
# a tag file that is based on the input files it reads. 

GENERATE_TAGFILE       = doc/html/@lac_doxygen_output_tagfile@.tag

# The PERL_PATH should be the absolute path and name of the perl script 
# interpreter (i.e. the result of `which perl'). 

PERL_PATH              = @PERL@

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is 
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz, a graph visualization 
# toolkit from AT&T and Lucent Bell Labs. The other options in this section 
# have no effect if this option is set to NO (the default) 

HAVE_DOT               = @HAVE_DOT@

# The DOTFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that 
# contain dot files that are included in the documentation (see the 
# \dotfile command).

DOTFILE_DIRS           =  @lac_doxygen_srcdirs@ \
                          @lac_doxygen_examples@
