Cobalt cdbwriter db2 DDL generation script information

Site configuration
------------------

Modify cobalt-db-config.  Comments in the config file explain the
various settings.  Some parameters in cobalt.conf must match what was
specified in cobalt-db-config, and are noted in the comments.  Sites
may want to keep this file someplace safe as it will be referenced
by future DDL generation scripts if schema changes are necessary.

Base DDL generation
-------------------

After modifying cobalt-db-config, execute the following script:

build-cdbwriter-ddl.sh

The script will create DDL appropriate for creating all required database
entries for cdbwriter.



Change log
----------

10/07/2010 - Initial Release, generates base DDL (cheetah)
