Changes from previous Cobalt Versions

Changes to 0.99.0pre28

* sequence number and acknowledgements added to base components.  This should
    prevent repeat messages from triggering actions multiple times.


Changes to 0.99.0pre27

* Restored COBALT_JOBID and COBALT_RESID in back-end jobs. This was erroniously
    removed in 0.99.0pre26.


Changes to 0.99.0pre26

* Fixed bug where environmental variables passed into a job from the --env flag
    of qsub and qalter would leak into the environment of bgforker and from 
    there into subsequent mpirun process environments.  These did not leak 
    into the backend-job environments.  Cluster-system component jobs did not
    see issues with this due to an apparent bug in envrionment handling.

* A job's exit status is now added to the Cobalt Database as exit_status
* COBALT_RESID is set in mpirun jobs


Changes to 0.99.0pre25

* Various timezone formatting changes including:
    - setres takes the reservation time depending on what TZ is set to
    - qstat and showres show times in a unified format, that includes
        offset and three-letter timezone designation
    - showres has a flag --oldts where it shows timestamps in the original
        format for compatibility with old scripts
* Forker was not handling spaces in arguments to scripts correctly
* schedctl no longer gives an erronious error message about requiring a job id 
    for --start, --stop 
* Statemachine state-transition function pointers are now regenerated at 
    restart as well as job initialization, to allow for transparent state-
    machine adjustments


Changes to 0.99.0pre24

* Fixes for arguments to pre and post scripts for jobs
* showres reverted to not include id's
* Fixes for script-mode jobs


changes to 0.99.0pre23

* Script jobs run with their own shells from forker to prevent 32/64 bit execution environment issues

changes to 0.99.0pre22

* Bgforker modified so that helper scripts can be run
* KNOWN ISSUE: job preemption is not working correctly in this version.  
* Resid now added to jobs at runtime, if they are run in a reservation.
* Fix for partially overlapping partitions being scheduled at the same time
    and properly detecting reservations.

changes to 0.99.0pre21

* Fix to reduce chance of cluster system nodes from being hung-up on job exit.
* Adding in backfill prediction functionality.  This is by default disabled.
* Various fixes and updates to the mk_* cobalt backup scripts.  These can be 
    used to restore state should a change that is destructive to statefiles is
    made (like the 0.99.0pre16 to 0.99.0pre17 change).
* resid and cycleid can be set via setres
* time.sleep() wrapped to prevent kernel level IOError from creeping out on 
    ppc64 linux platforms.  


changes to 0.99.0pre20

* stderr log messages now contain timestamps
* ensemble jobs that use -nofree without a -wait free are now cleaned up properly
* environment variables in cert, key and ca options in config files are expanded

changes to 0.99.0pre19
