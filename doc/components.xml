    <title>bgsched</title>

    <para>
      bgsched keeps an internal representation of the partitions
      it has to schedule. These partitions can be queried with the
      <filename>partadm.py</filename> command. These partitions must be 
      manually defined. By default, no partitions are
      definied. Partition definitions contain information including
      partition name, size, dependencies (contained partitions), and a
      list of valid queues. Other information is also tracked about
      partitions. An overall state is maintained (idle or busy). Note
      that partition dependencies cannot contain nonexistant
      partitions; that is, if a partition is deleted, it must be
      removed from any dependency lists it is in. 
    </para>

    <para>
      The standard operations of bgsched are fairly simple. The
      scheduler queries the queue manager, compares the list of jobs
      it received with the list of jobs that it already knew about,
      and appropriately deals with any discrepancies. When partitions
      are free and idle jobs are in the queue, it attempts to
      schedule. When jobs disappear, the partition previously occupied
      by the job is freed.

      <title>Potential Problems</title>

      <para>
	Several sorts of problems can occur to cause problems with the
	scheduler. Some of its data is maintained in other components
	or in the DB2 database for BG/L. Failures in this other
	software can render the scheduler unable to function
	properly. In case of either failure, odds are good that
	scheduling will be the least of your worries. There are error
	messages bgsched will report upon connection failures.
